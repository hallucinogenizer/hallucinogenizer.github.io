            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>It started in <b>8th Grade</b> when I made a facemash website (inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard
                project) for my school. By high school, I had built a <b>Clinic Management System</b> and tested it in
                Murad Clinic, Lahore.</p>
            <p>I brought my passion to LUMS and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science with my final year project
                being the HEC-funded <a href="https://opendata.com.pk" target="_blank"><b>Open Data Pakistan</b></a>,
                based on the open source <a href="https://ckan.org" target="_blank">CKAN project</a>. During this time,
                I built a usability-centric <b>LCMS and Acquisition System</b> for the <a href="https://iec.org.pk"
                    target="_blank">Institute of Emerging Careers</a>. With this, I gradually specialized in EdTech and
                open source platforms.</p>

                <p>IEC teaches emerging technologies to students. They receive <b>thousands of applications</b> for each
                    cohort and use a multi-step Acquisition Process to shortlist candidates, which includes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Application</li>
                    <li>Assessment</li>
                    <li>Orientation</li>
                    <li>Interviews</li>
                    <li>Zero Week</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Students that apply for IEC Cohorts often come from a <b>low-computer-literacy background</b> and
                    hence had problems using the Assessments Systems IEC was using. IEC hired me to solve this problem.
                    My Assessments System has been in use for 2 cohorts now and has had an <b>average student rating of
                        4.5/5</b> from thousands of reviews.</p>
                <p>The portal is <b>server-side routed with ExpressJS</b> and React is used merely for UI rendering.
                    React-router was not used. This decision was made to avoid the excessive load of client-side routing
                    on students' low-powered computers. The decision to use <b>relational databases</b> was made as it
                    allows us to enforce database-level logic constraints of relationships between eitities such as
                    Assessments, Sections, Questions, and Options. The system is hosted on <b>AWS EC2</b> and uses the
                    <b>AWS Simple Email Service (SES)</b>.

                <p>Open Data Pakistan is run by the National Center for Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC), Lahore
                    University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and Higher Education Commission (HEC). It is recognized as
                    one of the top CKAN portals of the world by <a
                        href="https://datashades.info/portal/https%3A%2F%2Fopendata.com.pk%2F"
                        target="_blank">DataShades</a>. It is a
                    collaborative effort to help provide open data to all kinds of users.</p>
                <p>This project was started in 2019 by a team belonging to the LUMS Batch of 2020 students. After their
                    graduation, it was taken up by Batch of 2021 students, and then passed on to me and my team (Batch
                    of 2022).</p>
                <p>We not only understood the work of our previous batches, but reproduced it from scratch to understand
                    it better. We upgraded CKAN from v2.8 to v2.9, added new features such as organization-level
                    authorization, theming, and contributed several issues to the Open Source Project in the process.
